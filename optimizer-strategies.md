## Define a Strategy - What does success look like?

Might be a simple thing to ask but not always so simple to answer. There are competing objectives and things to think about in everything we do, so you may be trying to achieve many things when introducing Bidstream Optimizer.

While there may be more than one ambition it's good to have an overarching objective. That way you can be clear on what success looks like and set targets to achieving this.

To help we have described here some popular strategies worth considering. More than one of these may be important but aim for one to be primary.

DEMAND-SIDE STRATEGIES

These strategies are most suited to a demand platform (DSP) or a supply platform that is ingesting inventory from a third party via API.

Strategy | Description | Metric
:--- | :--- | :---
Remove low quality inventory | I want to remove any fraudulent or low quality inventory from my bidstream | Authentication Rate
Reduce infrastructure costs without affecting topline revenue | :--- | :---
Maximize top line revenue but not increase infrastructure costs | :--- | :---
Enrich bid requests with new data to maximize revenue (as a supplier) | :--- | :---
Turn on new supply | :--- | :---

SUPPLY-SIDE STRATEGIES

These strategies are for a supply platform that is managing the outbound bidstream it is sending to it's demand partners.

Strategy | Description | Metric
:--- | :--- | :---
Profile demand partner bidstream to inventory that generates value to a fixed output QPS | :--- | :---
Enrich bid requests with new data to maximize revenue | :--- | :---
Turn on new demand | :--- | :---
