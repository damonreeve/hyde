# Case Study

Bidstream Optimizer is a powerful product, one that helps our clients achieve a variety of busines goals. Some of the most common Bidstream Optimizer strategies implemented by our clients include the following:

* Maximizing the commercial value of a bidstream
* Removing arbitraged or duplicated bid requests
* Removing fraudulent bid requests
* Filtering out bid requests they can't sell

Bidstream Optimizer can execute on these strategies quickly and with minimal disruption. Results are immediate.

Let's look at the value of Bidstream Optimizer from the perspective of a client that wants to maximize the commercial value of their bidstream. We'll illustrate how intelligent filtering can dramatically increase revenue, even as the bidstream is held constant.

## 1. Maximizing the commercial value of a bidstream

Limitations on infrastructure capacity can hinder growth. Often a client will find themselves with the untapped demand, but it lies fallow until they can expand. Bidstream Optimizer can monetize this demand *with no increase in infrastructure cost* by intelligent filtering of the bidstream. Bid requests with minimal potential for revenue are filtered out, leaving a more potent bidstream flowing through the existing infrastructure. Let's look at an illustration:

 | BASELINE | CONSERVATIVE  | AGGRESSIVE |
:--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
AD Filter Setting | 0% | 20% | 60% |
Allowable QPS | 42,432 | 53,040 | 106,080 |
 **Revenue** | | | |
Incoming Revenue | $113,294 | $141,617 | $283,235 |
Revenue Retention Rate | 100% | 99% | 78% |
Retained Revenue | $113,294 | $141,008 | $220,753 |
 **Cost** | | | |
Incoming QPS | 42,432 | 53,040 | 106,080 |
Filter Rate | 0% | 20% | 60% |
QPS Cost | $63,648 | $63,648 | $63,648 |
 **Profit** | | | |
Profit After Filtering | $49,646 | $77,360 | $157,105 |
AD Fees | $0 | $9,314 | $33,238
Final Profit | $49,646 | $68,046 | $123,867 |
 | | | |
 **% Increase in Profit** | **0.0%** | **37.1%** | **149.5%** |

In the example above, the greater the filter rate, the greater the QPS (and potential revenue!) the client can expose themselves to. Filtering cuts back dramatically on costs, but only moderately on revenue, increasing profit with every unproductive bid request that's filtered out.
