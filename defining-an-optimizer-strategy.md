* Reduce infrastructure costs without affecting topline revenue
* Maximize top line revenue but not increase infrastructure costs

* Turn on new supply

OUTBOUND STRATEGIES
* Profile demand partner bidstream to inventory that generates value to a fixed output QPS
* Enrich bid requests with new data to maximize revenue
* Turn on new demand
