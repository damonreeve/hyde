Please find the attached spreadsheet that gives two real world examples of using Authenticated.

Example 1 - Reducing QPS (Constant Net Revenue Worksheet)
In this example, you can see the effect of using Authenticated at different filter rates, and the vastly lowered QPS needed to achieve the same spend levels.  At the highest filter setting, the same spend can be achieved with 1/3 of the inbound traffic.  This can reduce infrastructure costs by more than a third.

Example 2 - Increasing Bidstream Revenue (Constant QPS Worksheet)
In this example, Authenticated was used to improve the quality of the bidstream - and you can see the effect of different Authenticated settings for the same QPS levels.  Authenticated can deliver higher quality, more commercially viable inventory, so that if AOL advertisers have latent demand, the same QPS can generate 2.5x more profit (e.g. net revenues minus infrastructure costs and Authenticated fees), and 4x more revenues.

In both examples, Authenticated uses a commercial model and a quality model to achieve these results.  The underlying raw SSP traffic in this example had a 2% bid rate, 50% win rate, and 75% impression rate before Authenticated was enabled.

Authenticated fees are $1K + 30% revenue uplift in this case.

We will also send through the before/after metrics regarding supply quality for each of the cases (e.g. recycled/arbitraged inventory, accurately described inventory, etc.)
