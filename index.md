# Welcome

Bidstream Optimizer is a technology that help platforms, [DSPs](#optimizer-for-dsps) and [SSPs](#optimizer-for-exchanges-and-ssps), generate greater value from a programmatic supply bidstream. The purpose for employing Bidstream Optimizer can be varied, to:

* Generate more revenue from current supply
* Throttle the bidstream to reduce load on current infrastructure
* Reduce platform operating costs
* Have greater control over supply quality
* Enrich the bidstream with additional data for improved targeting or filtering

Bidstream Optimizer can help a platform operator achieve those goals.

## Optimizer for Exchanges and SSPs

Bidstream Optimizer can be integrated with an SSP in two different ways:
1. For managing inbound third party ad network or exchange API supply
1. For managing outbound bidstreams sent to demand partners

## Optimizer for DSPs

Bidstream Optimizer is integrated in front of the client bidder to manage inbound bidstreams from supply partners.
