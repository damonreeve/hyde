Bidstream Optimizer is a technology that help platforms, DSPs and SSPs, generate greater value from a programmatic supply bidstream. The purpose for employing Bidstream Optimizer can be varied, to:

* Generate more revenue from current supply
* Throttle the bidstream to reduce load on current infrastructure
* Reduce platform operating costs
* Have greater control over supply quality
* Enrich the bidstream with additional data for improved targeting or filtering

Bidstream Optimizer can help a platform operator achieve those goals.
